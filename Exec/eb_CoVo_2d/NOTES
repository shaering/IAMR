This case is mainly intended to test the convergence order of IAMR convective scheme.
As such please refrain to modify the input.2d.CoVo_Convergence file.

To evaluate the convergence use the following:
./multiRuns.py --input_file inputs.2d.CoVo_Convergence --test_name IAMR_CoVo

Several simulations at increasing resolution will be performed (the list of resolution can be change in the multiRuns.py script)

Then use the following:
./pprocConvOrder.py <path_to_fcompare.gnu.ex> --test_name IAMR_CoVo

This will extract the error of each simulation and create a plot L2-error norm vs. resolution. Note again that the list of desired resolution must adadapted in pprocConvOrder.py.
